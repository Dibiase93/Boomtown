# Boomtown üèô

First half of Boomtown project, this project was based off building a server containing that database for our App.

### Learning Curve

This project was a very good challenge. I got a chance to learn how the database was built on server side. This project also gave me a good chance to further improve writing JavaScript functions.

#### Challenges

My biggest challenge was writing the functions on the pg-resource.js file which converted the Postgres data into workable JavaScript data.

EG.

```
const newItemTag = await postgres.query({
text: `INSERT INTO itemtags (tagid, itemid) VALUES ${tagsQueryString([tags], itemId)}`,
values: tagId
});
```

## Server
